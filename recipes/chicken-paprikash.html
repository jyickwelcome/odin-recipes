    <h2>Authentic Hungarian Chicken Paprikash Recipe</h2>
    <p>This recipe is an authentic dish that is sure to bring Hungary into your home.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons pork lard , or butter (lard is traditionally used and we strongly recommend it for the best flavor)</li>
        <li>3 pounds chicken pieces, bone-in and skin-on (this is traditional and recommended because it creates the most flavor, but alternatively you can use boneless/skinless pieces of chicken)</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, very finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>2 Roma tomatoes, seeds removed and very finely diced</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoons quality, genuine imported sweet Hungarian paprika</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup full fat sour cream</li>
        <li>1 package of extra wide egg noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the lard in a heavy pot and brown the chicken on all sides.  Transfer the chicken to a plate.  In the same oil, add the onions and fry until golden brown.  Add the garlic and tomatoes and fry another 2-3 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the paprika, salt and pepper (paprika becomes bitter if scorched).</li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the pot and place it back over the heat.  Pour in the chicken broth. The chicken should be mostly covered. Bring it to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 40 minutes. Remove the chicken and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir the flour into the sour cream/cream mixture to form a smooth paste. Stir the cream mixture into the sauce, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Bring it to a simmer for a couple of minutes until the sauce is thickened. Add salt and pepper to taste. Return the chicken to the sauce and simmer to heat through.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken paprikash with egg noodles</li>
    </ol>
