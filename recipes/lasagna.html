        <li>Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>Make the Bolognese Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the vegetables and garlic in a processor and mix until they’re finely chopped (just a few pulses should do it).</li>
        <li>Heat a large Dutch oven or saucepan on the stovetop, add the oil, and once hot, add the vegetables and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook until soft and starting to brown a bit. (10-15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the pork and beef (and pancetta or bacon, if using) and cook until brown. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a spoon as you stir if it's getting dark. (15 mins). Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another few minutes. Add the liquid ingredients - red wine first, allowing to reduce for a few minutes, then add the tomatoes, milk and stock. Add the bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce, uncovered, for 2 - 3 hours, stirring occasionally. You may need to add more chicken stock (or water) if the sauce starts to get too dry. When it’s done, fish out the bay leaves and leave to cool for 20 minutes (refrigerate when cool if assembling lasagna the next day).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Make the Béchamel Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>On medium heat, melt butter in a medium saucepan. Add the flour, stir and cook for a minute. Add ¼ cup of the milk in a slow drizzle, whisking constantly until smooth. Add another ¼ cup and whisk until smooth. Keep adding the rest of the milk gradually while constantly whisking.</li>
        <li>Add the salt, garlic, nutmeg and few grinds of black pepper, bring the mixture to a lower simmer and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat and stir in fontina, a handful at a time, until melted (if it doesn't fully melt, turn on low heat and stir until just melted and smooth). Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assemble All Together</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
        <li>In a 9×13-inch rectangular baking dish, spread ¼ cup of the béchamel (to keep noodles from sticking to the bottom). Add the first pasta layer, cutting pieces as needed to fill the dish. Ladle 1 generous cup bolognese sauce over the noodles, spreading it evenly. Drizzle ½ cup béchamel over the bolognese (don't worry about smoothing it out) . Sprinkle the layer with ⅓ cup parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process (pasta, bolognese, béchamel, parmesan) until the dish is filled (you might get 4 or 5 layers) and end with a layer of pasta. Spread over a ¼ cup of the béchamel(or whatever you have left) and sprinkle ⅓ cup parmesan.</li>
        <li>Bake for around 40 minutes until bubbly and browned on top. Let sit for at least 10 minutes before cutting. Serve with salad straight out of a box because honestly, you’ll be too exhausted to make anything else. And wine. Lots of wine.</li>
    </ol>
